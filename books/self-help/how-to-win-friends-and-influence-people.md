## How to win people to your way of thinking

### Principle 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
  - Always avoid the acute angle.
  - Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.
  - A man convinced against his will Is of the same opinion still.
  - If you argue, rankle & contradict, you may never achieve person's good will.
  - Story of a tax officer, where he was shouting to affirm his authority, when handled with praise, gave decision in favour.

  - Distrust your first instinctive impression.
  - Control your temper.
  - Listen first.
  - Look for areas of agreement.
