## How to win people to your way of thinking

### Principle 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
  - Always avoid the acute angle.
  - Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.
  - A man convinced against his will Is of the same opinion still.
  - If you argue, rankle & contradict, you may never achieve person's good will.
  - Story of a tax officer, where he was shouting to affirm his authority, when handled with praise, gave decision in favour.
  
#### To avoid the argument
  - Welcome disagreement- "If two person always agree, one of them is unnecessary"
  - Distrust your first instinctive impression.
  - Control your temper.
  - Listen first.
  - Look for areas of agreement.

### Principle 2: Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're Wrong".
  - "Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown proposed as things forgot" -Alexander pope

### Principle 3: If you are wrong, admit it quickly & emphatically.
  - Story: Policeman asked not to let dog run loose in the park. Next day after author admitted his mistake by saying "Officer, you've caught me red handed. I'm guilty, I have no alibis, no excuses. You warned me last week if I bought the dog out here again without a muzzle you would fine me".
    His Response: "Well now, I know it's a temptation to let a little dog like that have a run out here when nobody is around. But a little dog like that isn't going to harm anybody".

    This shows that the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the *magnanimous* attitude of showing mercy.
  - There is certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one's errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the error.
  - Story: Ferdinand E.Warren, a commercial artist, used this technique to win the good will of a *petulant*, scolding buyer of art.
    This buyer, would attack, criticize the artist for even the minor error. AS he entered his room, he start his heat out on the artist, artist said: "Mr So-and-so, if what you say is true, I am at fault & there is absolutely no excuse for my blunder. I have been doing drawing for you for long enough to know better, I'm ashamed of myself".
    Immediately the buyer started defending the artist and said it is a small mistake. Artist would cut him in between and criticize himself again, and buyer would defend him.
  - Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes - and most fools do - but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility & exultation to admit one's mistake.
  - By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.
