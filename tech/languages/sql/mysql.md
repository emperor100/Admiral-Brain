### Database Concurrency Control

Queries that use the `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` clause are typically used in scenarios where multiple transactions may concurrently access and update rows in a database table, and there is a need to handle concurrency control. This mechanism is commonly used in the context of relational databases to avoid conflicts and ensure data consistency in a multi-user environment.

Example: If we want to process certain rows in a concurrent environment, you can do it this way
```sql

START TRANSACTION

SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE x = y LIMIT 10
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED

-- Process the rows here and then release the lock

COMMIT TRANSACTION
```
