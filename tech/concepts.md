### Server Sent Events
- Server Sent Events (SSE) is a webtechnology that enables servers to push real time data to clients over HTTP. 
- Unlike Websockets which are bidirectional, SSE only sends data from server to client, a unidirectional communication protocol.
- SSE is also built on top of HTTP protocol, where client connects to the server using `EventSource API`, which provides persistent connection between client and server.
- SSE has multiple use cases such as
  - Stock tickers
  - Real-time notification
  - Text streaming (ChatGPT)
  - Auction and biddings
  - System monitoring
